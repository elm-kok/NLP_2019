    "In this exercise, you are going to build a set of deep learning models on a (sort of) real world task using Tensorflow and Keras. Tensorflow is a deep learning framwork developed by Google, and Keras is a frontend library built on top of Tensorflow (or Theano, CNTK) to provide an easier way to use standard layers and networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you will need to build deep learning models for word tokenization in Thai (แบ่งเว้นวรรคภาษาไทย) using NECTEC's BEST corpus. You will build one model for each of the following type:\n",
    "- Fully Connected (Feedforward) Neural Network\n",
    "- One-Dimentional Convolution Neural Network (1D-CNN)\n",
    "- Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",
    "\n",
    "and one more model of your choice to achieve the highest score possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide the code for data cleaning and some starter code for keras in this notebook but feel free to modify those parts to suit your needs. You can also complete this exercise using only Tensorflow (without using Keras). Feel free to use additional libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) as long as you have a model for each type mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have already installed Tensorflow and Keras with python3 and had GPU enabled. If you run this exercise on GCloud using the provided disk image you are all set.\n",
